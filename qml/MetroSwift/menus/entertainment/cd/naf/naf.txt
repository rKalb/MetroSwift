The Naked and Famous are a New Zealand post-punk revival band from Auckland. They formed in 2008 when Thom Powers and Alisa Xayalith recorded EPs This Machine and No Light with engineer Aaron Short, a fellow student at Auckland's MAINZ music college. The EPs were subsequently released on local independent label Round Trip Mars and Powers and Xayalith began performing live with Ben Knapp and Jordan Clark on bass and drums respectively. The Naked and Famous released their debut studio album, Passive Me, Aggressive You, on 6 September 2010 on their own label, Somewhat Damaged.[2] The album was produced by Thom Powers and Aaron Short and mixed by Billy Bush.
